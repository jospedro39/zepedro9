## Preview

## How to use
1. Login to your WonderCMS website.
2. Click "Settings" and click "Themes".
3. Find theme in the list and click "install".
4. In the "General" tab, select theme to activate it.

## Features

The theme adds a parallax header to each page. You can edit the title and subtitle in the header just by clicking on it.
This works the best with the summernote plugin, but as a [floating editor](https://www.wondercms.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=1252).

You can set a background by uploding a file using the page title as the filename. Any extention works, but I reccomend using jpeg files.

Example:

home.jpg gets used as the homepage background
home.png gets used as the homepage background
example.webp gets used as the background for the page `/example`

## Developer notes
This is just a test of mine. Use at your own risk. Works best with a [floating summernote](https://www.wondercms.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=1252) editor.
